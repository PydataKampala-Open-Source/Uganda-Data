# Uganda-Data
An overwhelming majority of Uganda Data is dirty, fragmented, inaccessible and not machine-readable. This has hindered
accessibility, redistribution and use of data for research, academia or industry for data-backed applications.
This project seeks to create clean, accessible, reproducible and standardized IUganda datasets accross key sectors.
